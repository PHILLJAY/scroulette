# SCRoulette
Website to randomly acess a soundcloud song.

## How it works
Soundcloud has a url shortner that follows the format of on.soundcloud.com/{xxxxx} where each x is a randomly generated alphanumeric character. This website simply generates a string and opens it in a new tab.

## To do:
- Add a check to see if link is valid
